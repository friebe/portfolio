Hey, I am Jan Friebe a software developer from Germany NRW.

I am an ambitious, willing to learn and passionate developer with fun and interest in new technologies especially in frontend related topics. 

At the moment I work as a developer at [DELOS IT GmbH](https://delos.biz/). In our application we use the PHP web application framework [symfony](https://symfony.com/) as well a lot of [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and vanilla JavaScript.

Since 2012 I got to know the content management system [Contao](https://delos.biz/) with its diverse programming possibilities as an editor and developer and have been involved in the community since then.

Outside of programming, I enjoy digital or analog drawing and make sport to stay fit. 
Reading books about self-organization, biographies of great personalities and non fiction books offers me variety from my everyday life and relax me.
